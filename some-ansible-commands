HOW TO communicate with HOST WITH COMMAND AND ARGUMENT

Ping module
ansible hostName -m ping

shell module
ansible hostName -m shell -a "df -h"  ---> to show available space or storage size or memory size of the host  or server or ec2-server

ansible hostname -m shell -a "df -h" --extra-vars "password=admin123"   storage size for host with variable password

ansible hostname -m shell -a "kubectl get nodes" --extra-vars "password=admin123" to list nodes in k8s host with variable password 

playbook command
ansible-playbook playbookFileName ---->   for default for default inventory host file which is  (/etc/ansible/hosts )

ansible-playbook playbookFileName  -i custom-hosts -> for default for default inventory host file which is  ( if the custom host file was named custom-hosts)

ansible-playbook playbookFileName --syntax-check ---->   to check if thee is syntax error

ansible-playbook playbookFileName --check ----> to run a dry-run to know what you are expected to see before. it can also run as syntax.

 ansible serverName -m setup -i hosts    to check the linux distribution of your host

 ansible k8s -m shell -a "kubectl get pod" --vault-password=v-file
 
ansible vault command

FOR GROUP VARIABLE 

amsible-vault encrypt /etc/ansible/directoryName/passwordName       for default inventory host file

amsible-vault encrypt /etc/ansible/directoryName/passwordName       for default inventory host file

it wil ask you to enter new vault password, enter the password you like and confirm the password

amsible k8s-kops -m ping --ask-vault-pass       for default inventory host file

enter the vault password     

For the purpose of automation. you can create a file and paste the vault paasowrd insid. like

kim123

which is the vault password you maybe have used and then save it in a file

ansible k8s -m shell -a "kubectl get pod" --vault-password=passwordFileName

it will list pods in k8s cluster without asking for vault password

ansible k8s -m ping --vault-password=passwordFileName

NOTE:

When you want to run a command in you host via your ansible environment, you must parse a shell module -m shell   and also parse an argument -a   and the command will be inside ""  like below

amsible k8s -m shell -a "kubectl get nodes" --ask-vault-pass

ansible k8s -m shell -a "df -h" --ask-vault-pass

If you want a situation whereby you do not want the vault to ask for passpwrd for the 
benefit of automation, You can also just create a vault password file.

Let say the vault password is kim123. the will will paste the below into the file

password: kim123

and save-quit.

if you run the command

ansible k8s -m shell -a "kubectl get pod" --vault-password=v-file

it will list pods in k8s cluster without asking for vault passwrd

ansible k8s -m ping --vault-password=v-file

NOTE:

This vault password configuration that you have done will take over your enter ansible environment so that anytime you want to perform any command, you would have to parse the vault password command  

--vault-password=passwordFileName       ----> when vault password is saved it in a file

     or

--ask-vault-pass        ----> when vault password is not saved it in a file

if you run

ansible all -m ping --vault-password=v-file.yml           for a default inventory file

it will ping everything hosts in your default inventory file

The vault passowrd is the key that will open your ansible environment for any action or command to take place
