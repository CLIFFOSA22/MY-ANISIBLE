HOW TO communicate with HOST WITH COMMAND AND ARGUMENT

Ping module
ansible hostName -m ping

shell module
ansible hostName -m shell -a "df -h"  ---> to show available space or storage size or memory size of the host  or server or ec2-server

ansible hostname -m shell -a "df -h" --extra-vars "password=admin123"   storage size for host with variable password

ansible hostname -m shell -a "kubectl get nodes" --extra-vars "password=admin123" to list nodes in k8s host with variable password 

playbook command
ansible-playbook playbookFileName ---->   for default for default inventory host file which is  (/etc/ansible/hosts )

ansible-playbook playbookFileName  -i custom-hosts -> for default for default inventory host file which is  ( if the custom host file was named custom-hosts)

ansible-playbook playbookFileName --syntax-check ---->   to check if thee is syntax error

ansible-playbook playbookFileName --check ----> to run a dry-run to know what you are expected to see before. it can also run as syntax.

 ansible serverName -m setup -i hosts    to check the linux distribution of your host

 ansible k8s -m shell -a "kubectl get pod" --vault-password=v-file
 
ansible vault command
amsible k8s -m ping --ask-vault-pass       for default inventory host file

note if the group variable was created in your custom host file (if the custom host file you created was custom-host), you run the below

amsible k8s -m ping -i custom-hosts --ask-vault-pass        for custom inventory host file ( if the custom host file was named custom-hosts)      

For the purpose of automation. you can create a file and paste the vault paasowrd insid. like (password=kim123)

ansible k8s -m shell -a "kubectl get pod" --vault-password=passwordFileName

it will list pods in k8s cluster without asking for vault password

ansible k8s -m ping --vault-password=passwordFileName

NOTE:

When you want to run a command in you host via your ansible environment, you must parse a shell module -m shell   and also parse an argument -a   and the command will be inside ""  like below

amsible k8s -m shell -a "kubectl get nodes" --ask-vault-pass

ansible k8s -m shell -a "df -h" --ask-vault-pass

If you want a situation whereby you do not want the vault to ask for passpwrd for the 
benefit of automation, You can also just create a vault password file.

Let say the vault password is kim123. the will will paste the below into the file

password: kim123

and save-quit.

if you run the command

ansible k8s -m shell -a "kubectl get pod" --vault-password=v-file

it will list pods in k8s cluster without asking for vault passwrd

ansible k8s -m ping --vault-password=v-file
