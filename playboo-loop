You can use a playbook loop to install packages like vim, wget, git, nano, zip, unzip as below

Playbooks with loops

- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
   - name: Install list of packages
     yum:
       name: ['nano', 'wget', 'vim', 'zip', 'unzip']
     when: ("ansible_distribution" == "RedHat")

or

i prefer the below

- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install list of packages
      yum: name='{{item}}' state=present
      with_items:
       - nano
       - wget
       - vim
       - zip
       - unzip  

You can install loop in just one host like below

- hosts: web
  become: true
  tasks:
   - name: Install list of packages
     package:
       name: ['nano', 'wget', 'vim', 'zip', 'unzip']
