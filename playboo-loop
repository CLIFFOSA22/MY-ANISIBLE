You can use a playbook loop to install packages like vim, wget, git, nano, zip, unzip as below

- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
   - name: Install list of packages
     yum:
       name: ['nano', 'wget', 'vim', 'zip', 'unzip']
       state: present

or


- hosts: dev
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install list of packages
      package: name='{{item}}' state=present
      with_items:
       - nano
       - wget
       - vim
       - zip
       - unzip  
     state: present


both are the same but i think the first one is simplier but use package as the module by replaing yum with package. package module can be used in all linux 
distribution


You can install loop in just one host like below

- hosts: dev
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install list of packages
      package: name='{{item}}' state=present
      with_items:
       - nano
       - wget
       - vim
       - zip
       - unzip  
     state: present
