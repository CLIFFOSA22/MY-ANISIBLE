This a playbook that has a condition attached to the file. like the word "when"  as see below

- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
   - name: Install list of packages
     yum:
       name: ['nano', 'wget', 'vim', 'zip', 'unzip']
       state: present
  when: ("ansible_distribution" == "RedHat")

  This means that it can only install the packages on only linux distribution with redhat engine. It means it cannot install in ubuntu
